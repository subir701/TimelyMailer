# TimelyMailer
 Scope
âœ… What features will your system have?
Users can schedule emails to be sent at a specific date and time.

A single email can be sent to multiple recipients at once.

Users can edit the:

Scheduled time

Email content

Recipient list

The system supports automatic retry if sending fails (due to temporary issues like internet outage or SMTP error).

Multithreaded processing to handle multiple email deliveries in parallel, improving efficiency and scalability.

ðŸ‘¥ Who are the users?
Job seekers who want to send cold emails for job opportunities:

Often job posts appear late at night, and emailing immediately may reduce visibility.

This system ensures the mail reaches at the right time â€” e.g., next morning during office hours.

General users who need to send the same announcement/notice to a group of people (e.g., event organizers, teachers, HRs, etc.).

ðŸ§© What is the main problem you're solving?
Eliminates the need to manually write and send the same email to multiple people.

Removes the dependency on user being available at the scheduled time:

Once scheduled, the email is automatically sent at the desired time without further action.
